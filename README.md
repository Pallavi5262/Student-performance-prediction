# Student-performance-prediction
This project predicts student performance (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`) using machine learning. It preprocesses data, trains five models, and analyzes trends through visualizations. Users can input custom values for real-time predictions. Built with Pandas, Seaborn,and Scikit-learn, it outputs accuracy reports, graphs, and performance predictions.
