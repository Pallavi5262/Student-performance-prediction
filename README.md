# Student-performance-prediction
This project predicts student performance (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`) using machine learning. It processes student data by removing unnecessary columns, encoding categorical variables, and shuffling records for better training. The dataset is split into 70% training and 30% testing, and five models—Decision Tree, Random Forest, Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and MLP Classifier—are trained to classify student performance. The program also includes graphical visualizations to analyze trends based on factors like Grade, Gender, Semester, and Absenteeism. Additionally, users can input custom values such as the number of raised hands, discussions, and absenteeism to get real-time performance predictions. The project is implemented using Python with Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and NumPy. The expected output includes model accuracy, classification reports, performance graphs, and predicted student performance categories.
